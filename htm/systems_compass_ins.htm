<h1>Compass Variation</h1>

<p class="projectorMd">The compass variation allows you to account for the local magnetic declination to have the compass display true North instead of Magnetic North.  The value entered is added to the compass heading before it is displayed.</p>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li><p></p>For West Declination, use a positive number.</li>
  <li><p></p>For local East Declination, use a negative number.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Class="wow">"West is Best, East is Least"</li>
