<h1>Exercise: Follow a Vertical Feature</h1>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants get familiar with vertical control of the ROV.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Preparation</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Identify a vertical feature of significant depth without surrounding obstructions that can be followed by the ROV.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Participants should navigate on the surface to a vertical feature such as a line, piling or ladder.  upon arriving at the feature, dive the ROV while trying to keep the feature in the ROVs camera view.  Stop at the bottom (or about 20-30 feet if the feature continues deeper), and reverse direction to surface.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li>Tilt the camera in the direction of travel.</li>
  <li>Use the horizontal thrusters as necessary to maintain a close constant proximity to the vertical feature, and keep from rotating around it.</li>
  <li>If visibility is low, you may need to increase the lights.
  <li>The tether handler should pay out and retrieve tether as necessary to provide some slack and not impact the pilot's ability to control the ROV.</li>
  </ul>
