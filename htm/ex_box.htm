<h1>Exercise: Drive a Box</h1>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants get familiar with controlled turns, holding a constant heading and how the tether affects piloting to ROV.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Navigate away from the launch point for a distance of about 15 m.  Turn 90 degrees left or right, then navigate for another 10 m.  Then turn 90 degrees the same direction and navigate for another 10 m.  Reverse course and repeat the pattern in the opposite direction.  Repeat, increasing speed on each pass.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li>Pilots should watch the ROV and not worry about the video view at this point.</li>
  <li>Cross Controls - when the ROV is coming towards you, the left / right controls will seem reversed - When you move the joystick right, the ROV will turn to your left.</li>
  <li>The tether handler should pay out and retrieve tether as necessary to provide some slack and not impact the pilot's ability to control the ROV.</li>
  </ul>
