<h1>Exercise: Random Walk</h1>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants get familiar with the handling and responsiveness of the ROV.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Participants will navigate the ROV on the surface, starting, stopping, going forwards and backwards, and making left and right turns in a random pattern. Participants should start slowly and gradually increase the speed of the ROV as they get comfortable with its handling characteristics.  Participants should try to remain in an area about 5 to 10 m depending on the space available.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMD">
  <li>During this exercise, pilots should watch the ROV and not worry about the view from the ROV's camera.</li>
  <li>Cross Controls - when the ROV is coming towards you, the left / right controls will seem reversed - When you move the joystick right, the ROV will turn to your left.</li>
  <li>The tether handler should pay out and retrieve tether as necessary to provide some slack and not impact the pilot's ability to control the ROV.</li>
  </ul>
