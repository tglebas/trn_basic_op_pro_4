<h3>Video Recording Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the Text Overlay and capture still images while recording to create "index" frames that can be used to quickly navigate to specific sections of the recorded video.</li>
  <li>Turn on the Text Overlay at the beginning of the recording and to document specific highlights, but turn it off otherwise.</li>
  <li>Record a few seconds of video on the topside before commencing the dive - underwater video generally all looks the same.</li>
