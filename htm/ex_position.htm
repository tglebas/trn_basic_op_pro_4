<h1>Exercise: Pilot to and Hold a Position</h1>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants learn how to maintain a position taking into account the affect of the tether on piloting the ROV</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Preparation</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Identify a surface or shallow submerged object without surrounding obstructions that can be used as a target point.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Pilot to the target and hold the ROV as still as possible.</p>

<!--p-->
<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li>Use the horizontal thrusters as necessary to maintain a close constant proximity to the target, and keep from rotating around it.</li>
  <li>You may find that the tether wants to recoil and pull the ROV off target.  In order to compensate for this, you may need to pull more tether beyond the target.</li>
  <li>In high surge conditions, you may need to maintain a greater stand off distance to avoid being pushed into the target.</li>
  <li>The tether handler should pay out and retrieve tether as necessary to provide some slack and not impact the pilot's ability to control the ROV.</li>
  </ul>
