<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants learn how to recognize when the tether is twisted and which way to turn to untwist it.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Preparation</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Make sure the tether is not twisted and press the reset button on the turns indicator to zero it.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Pilot the ROV in a circle to twist the tether and increase the turns count.  Note the number of turns and the indicator that shows which way to unwind.  Turn the ROV in the direction of the indicator to reduce the turns count and remove the the twists in the tether.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li>The turns indicator is "North Up," which means North is aways at the top and the heading indication rotates as the ROV turns.  The heading indicator rotates in the same direction as the ROV.</li>
  <li>The turns counter can be used as a relative indication of the direction that the ROV is facing.</li>
  <li>When descending a vertical feature, the turns counter can help make sure you don't get wrapped around it.</li>
  </ul>
