<h1>Exercise: Follow Tether to Origin</h1>

<p>While operating the ROV, it will be necessary to return to the deployment point following the same route used to arrive at the zone of operations.  If the same route is not followed, or there are obstacles along the way, the tether can be snagged and the ROV may become stuck.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drive the ROV on the surface out to a distance of at least 30 meters.</p>
  <li>Turn the ROV around to obeserve the tether in the video.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You may need to tilt the camera up or down to find the tether bcause it generall lays in a coil shape in the water.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Follow the tether back to the point of deployment.</li>
  <li>Stay as close to the tether as possible.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In low visibility, if you lose sight of the tether, it may be hard to reacquire it in the view.</li>
    <li>You may need to tilt the camera up or down to keep the tether in the view.</li>
    <li>The tether handler should retrieve the tether as you return, but not pull to fast to affect the ability to pilot the ROV.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

<h2>Optional</h2>

<p>Drive the ROV around an obstable, such as a piling, and then return the ROV to the point of deployment.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>If the tether is free, but you cannot navigate the ROV around an obstable, you may be able to retrieve the ROV, disconnect it from the tether and then pull the tether back to the control panel.  Or, the reverse situation may work - retrieve the ROV, disconnect the tether from the control panel and then pull the tether to the ROV.</p>
