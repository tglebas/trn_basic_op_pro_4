<h2 class="projectorMd">Objective</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">This exercise helps participants learn how to use the compass to able to determine the heading of the ROV or turn the ROV to a specific heading.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Preparation</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Using a compass or the ROV on the surface, identify North to be used as a reference for being able to determine its orientation at any heading.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Technique</h2>

<p class="projectorMd">Turn the ROV and notice how the compass responds.  Note the starting point of the ROV, select a heading and turn the ROV to face the intended heading.  Follow this heading for about 5 to 10 meters.  Calculate the reverse bearing and turn the ROV to this bearing.  Follow this course to return to the original starting point.  While piloting during this exercise, observe the pitch and roll indicator.</p>

<h2 class="projectorMd">Tips</h2>

<ul class="projectorMd">
  <li>The compass is "Heads Up," which means the compass rose rotates and the heading is always displayed at the top.  Note that is rotates in the opposite direction from which way the ROV is turning.</li>
  </ul>
