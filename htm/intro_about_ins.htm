<h1>About this Documentation - Instructor Notes</h1>

<p>This documentation is designed to be delivered as a slide show.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slides for the customer and instructor should be customized for each delivery.  Custom "welcome.html" and "instructor.html" should be copied into the folder containing the html files.</li>
  <li>Instructors are encouraged NOT to read the slides, but to discuss the points included on each slide using their experiences.</li>
  <li>Instructors are encouraged to use the features of the system including using the book icon links to the user manual for more details about specific topics when warranted.</li>
  </ul>

<p>If you can't present information live to demonstrate operation (for example, showing how to resize instruments), you can use the Manual icon links to the user manual.  If you use the Manual icon, make sure to use the back button to get back to the slides.  Don't use the previous / next on the user manual.</p>

<p>Instructors should point out whether the optional sections will be covered or not.</p>

<p>Instructors can use the My_Notes feature to add points to the slides for specific presentations.</p>

<p>Participants will receive both an electronic copy and printed manual.  Participants can use the My_Notes feature to add notes to their local copy.</p>

<p>Suggestions for improvements are always welcome, including additional information to include in these instructor notes pages.</p>
