<h1>Exercise: Tether Tangle / Untangle</h1>

<p>There is a high probability that sometime during your piloting career you will encounter a tangled tether.</p>

<h2>Tether Tangle or Snag Rule #1</h2>

<p>Don't panic.</p>

<h2>Tether Tangle or Snag Rule #2</h2>

<p>Do not pull on the tether until you completely assess the situation, because this could tighten the tangle or snag making the situation worse.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Submerge the ROV to ensure a section of the tether behind the ROV is submerged.</li>
  <li>Drive the ROV in  a circle and cross over the tether.</li>
  <li>Dive below the tether.</li>
  <li>Drive to the center of the tether loop.</li>
  <li>Surface the ROV through the loop create a knot in the tether.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not pull the tether knot too tight or you may not be able to use the ROV to untie it.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Reverse your course to untie the knot.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Optional</h2>

<p>If you have an underwater structure you can entangle the tether around it and have another class participant untangle the tether.  Reverse the roles and repeat the exercise.</p>

<p>If you have two ROVs, you can have a pair of class participants tangle the tethers together and another pair of class participants untangle them.  Reverse the roles and repeat the exercise.</li>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>In some situations, you may not be able to untangle the tether or snag using just the motion of the ROV.  If you have a manipulator attached, you may be able to use it to free the tether.</p>
